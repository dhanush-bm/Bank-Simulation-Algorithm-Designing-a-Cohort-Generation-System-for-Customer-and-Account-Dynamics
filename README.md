# Bank-Simulation-Algorithm-Designing-a-Cohort-Generation-System-for-Customer-and-Account-Dynamics

•	Designed and implemented a Python program in Jupyter Notebook for simulating and analyzing business analytics data for 20,000 customers, following Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs) and utilizing Markdown for documentation.

•	Implemented effective logging mechanisms capturing timestamped events, source information, and performance metrics. Stored simulation results on disk for further analysis.

•	Conducted comprehensive functional testing to ensure program adherence to specified requirements. Analyzed cohort characteristics and account activities, providing valuable insights. Quantified project success through execution time, memory usage, and performance metrics.
